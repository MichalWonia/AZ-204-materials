Controlling Access to Events in Azure Event Grid
Azure Event Grid uses Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage access and define the level of permissions for different users or groups, 
allowing them to perform specific operations on Event Grid resources.

Built-in Roles for Event Grid
Azure Event Grid provides several built-in roles with specific permissions, which can be assigned to users or groups. 
These roles define what actions users can perform on Event Grid resources.

1. Event Grid Subscription Reader
- Permissions: Grants read-only access to Event Grid event subscriptions.
- Use Case: Ideal for users who need to view event subscriptions but not modify them.

2. Event Grid Subscription Contributor
- Permissions: Allows users to create, manage, and delete Event Grid event subscriptions.
- Use Case: Best for users responsible for managing subscriptions but not necessarily for creating or managing Event Grid topics or other resources.

3. Event Grid Contributor
- Permissions: Grants full management access to Event Grid resources, including the ability to create, manage, and delete topics and event subscriptions.
- Use Case: Suited for users who need to manage both event subscriptions and Event Grid topics.

4. Event Grid Data Sender
- Permissions: Allows users to send events to Event Grid topics.
- Use Case: Intended for users or services that need to publish events to Event Grid topics but do not need to manage other Event Grid resources.

Permissions for Event Subscriptions
Event Grid event subscriptions require specific permissions depending on the type of event handler you're using. 
The Event Grid Subscription Contributor role is required to manage event subscriptions, 
but other roles may be needed for the underlying event handler resource.

Required Permissions:
- For event handlers that are not webhooks (such as Event Hubs, Azure Storage Queues, or Service Bus),
you need write access to those resources to allow events to be sent.
- Specifically, you need the Microsoft.EventGrid/EventSubscriptions/Write permission on the resource that is the event source. 
This permission is required to create new event subscriptions at the resource scope.

Types of Event Grid Topics and Permissions
1. System Topics
- Description: These topics are predefined and provided by Azure services, such as Azure Storage, Azure Event Hubs, etc. 
They are automatically created when you create a specific resource.
- Permissions Required: You need to have permission to write a new event subscription at the scope of the resource publishing the event.
  - Format: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/{resource-provider}/{resource-type}/{resource-name}

2. Custom Topics
- Description: Custom topics are user-defined topics that are typically used for custom events or scenarios that are not tied to specific Azure services.
- Permissions Required: You need permission to write a new event subscription at the scope of the Event Grid topic.
  - Format: /subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{resource-group-name}/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/{topic-name}

Summary of Event Grid Access Control
1. RBAC Roles:
- Event Grid Subscription Reader: Read-only access to event subscriptions.
- Event Grid Subscription Contributor: Manage event subscriptions.
- Event Grid Contributor: Full access to create and manage Event Grid resources.
- Event Grid Data Sender: Permission to send events to Event Grid topics.

2. Permissions for Event Subscriptions:
- You need write permissions to create event subscriptions, either at the resource level (for system topics) 
or at the Event Grid topic level (for custom topics).

By using these roles and permissions, Azure Event Grid allows you to precisely control who can perform various tasks related to events, 
ensuring secure and appropriate access for different users.
