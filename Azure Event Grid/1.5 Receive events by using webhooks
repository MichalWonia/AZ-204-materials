1. Webhook Basics:
- Webhooks are used to receive events from Azure Event Grid by posting HTTP requests to an endpoint.
- When an event occurs, Event Grid sends a POST request with the event data.

2. Ownership Validation:
- To prevent abuse, Event Grid requires you to prove ownership of the webhook endpoint.
- Azure services like Logic Apps, Automation, and Functions handle this validation automatically.

3. Manual Validation for Custom Endpoints:
- If you're using a custom HTTP endpoint (e.g., an HTTP-triggered Azure Function), you must manually validate the subscription.
- Two types of validation are supported:
  - Synchronous Handshake: Event Grid sends a validation event, and your endpoint responds with a validation code to confirm ownership.
  - Asynchronous Handshake: If the endpoint can't respond synchronously (e.g., when using third-party services like Zapier), a manual validation URL is provided in the event. You must visit this URL within 5 minutes to complete the validation.

4. Event Grid Validation Process:
- Synchronous: Return the validation code in the response to confirm the subscription.
- Asynchronous (Manual): Visit the provided URL to complete validation within 5 minutes. If not completed, the subscription fails, and you must recreate it.

5. Important Notes:
- Use a signed certificate from a commercial Certificate Authority (CA), as self-signed certificates are not supported for validation.
- Ensure your webhook endpoint returns an HTTP status code 200 to acknowledge receipt of the validation event.
