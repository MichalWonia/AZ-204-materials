Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) Overview
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a global solution that helps deliver high-bandwidth content efficiently. 
It works by caching content at strategically placed nodes across the world, allowing users to access it more quickly. 
It also accelerates dynamic content through network optimizations such as route optimization, bypassing Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) limitations.

Key Benefits of Using Azure CDN:
- Improved Performance and User Experience:
  - Low latency: Caching content close to the end user means faster load times for websites and applications, improving overall user experience.
  - Reduced round trips: For applications requiring multiple round trips to load content, Azure CDN can drastically reduce this, speeding up the process.

- Scalability:
  - Instantaneous Load Handling: Azure CDN can handle sudden high traffic loads, like those encountered during a product launch, 
without putting pressure on the origin server.
  - Edge Servers: Content is distributed from the edge servers located closest to users, helping alleviate traffic from the origin server.

How Azure Content Delivery Network Works:
The process of content delivery with Azure CDN involves several key steps:

User Request:
- A user (e.g., Alice) requests a file using a special URL like <endpoint_name>.azureedge.net or a custom domain.
- The request is routed by DNS to the best performing Point of Presence (POP) location, typically the closest one geographically.

Edge Server Cache Check:
- If the requested content is already cached on an edge server, it will be served directly to the user (Alice).
- If the content isn’t cached, the edge server requests the file from the origin server (such as an Azure Web App, Azure Storage, etc.).

Caching and Serving the File:
- Once the origin server responds, the file is cached on the edge server.
- The file is then delivered to the original user (Alice), and it remains cached on the edge server until the Time-to-Live (TTL) 
specified in the file's HTTP headers expires.
- If no TTL is specified, a default TTL of seven days is applied.

Subsequent Requests:
- Other users who request the same file will be routed to the same POP. If the TTL hasn't expired, the content will be served directly from the cache, 
resulting in faster performance.

Requirements for Using Azure CDN:
Azure Subscription:
- You need at least one Azure subscription to use the CDN service.

Content Delivery Network Profile:
- A CDN profile is a collection of CDN endpoints. Each endpoint is a specific configuration of content delivery behavior 
that can be customized for different use cases (e.g., by internet domain or web application).
- You can create multiple profiles if you need to use different pricing tiers or configurations for different types of content or services.

Pricing:
- Pricing is applied at the CDN profile level. If you need to use a mix of pricing tiers (such as Standard and Premium), you must create multiple profiles.

Azure CDN Features:
- Dynamic Site Acceleration: Improves the performance of dynamic content that cannot be cached, speeding up user experiences.
- Caching Rules: Allows you to set rules for content caching, optimizing how content is stored and retrieved.
- Custom Domain Support (HTTPS): You can map custom domains to your CDN endpoints and secure the connection using HTTPS.
- Diagnostics Logs: Azure CDN provides diagnostic logs that allow you to monitor the performance and health of your CDN endpoints.
- File Compression: Compresses files before delivering them to users, reducing load times and improving efficiency.
- Geo-Filtering: Enables you to block or allow content delivery based on geographic location.

Limitations:
Azure subscriptions have default limits for the following resources:
- The number of CDN profiles that can be created.
- The number of endpoints in a CDN profile.
- The number of custom domains that can be mapped to an endpoint.

For detailed information on CDN limits, refer to the Azure CDN Subscription Limits.

Pricing Tiers:
Azure CDN offers several pricing tiers that cater to different needs. Depending on your application’s requirements, you can choose between:
- Standard: Basic CDN capabilities for general use.
- Premium: Higher performance and additional features, including better control over caching, security, and dynamic content acceleration.
