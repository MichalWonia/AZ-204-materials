🚀 What Are ACR Tasks?
ACR Tasks are cloud-based features in Azure that help you:
- Build container images for Linux, Windows, and ARM platforms.
- Shift early stages of container builds to the cloud.
- Automate image builds via triggers like:
  - Code commits
  - Base image updates
  - Scheduled timers

🔧 Task Types & Scenarios
⚡️ Quick Tasks
- Think of it as docker build + docker push, but in the cloud.
- Useful for on-demand builds without a local Docker installation.
- Perfect for inner-loop development to validate image builds before pushing code.

✅ Command:

az acr build --registry <RegistryName> --image <ImageName>

🔁 Automatically Triggered Tasks
Enable builds when:
- Source Code Updates
   - Triggered on commit or PR updates in GitHub or Azure DevOps.
   - Set up via:
      az acr task create --source <repo-url> ...

- Base Image Updates
  - Automatically rebuild dependent images when base images change.
  - Tracks updates from your own registry or public ones (like Docker Hub).

- Scheduled Builds (Timer Trigger)
  - Run tasks on a schedule.
  - Great for maintenance, nightly builds, or image validation routines.

🧩 Multi-step Tasks
Define a sequence of build, test, and deployment steps in YAML.

Example scenario:
1. Build app image
2. Run the app container
3. Build test image
4. Run test container (validates app)
5. If successful:
  - Build Helm chart
  - Deploy with helm upgrade

This lets you implement CI/CD workflows fully in the cloud using containers.

🖥️ Supported Platforms
By default, builds target Linux/amd64.

You can specify the platform using:
  --platform OS/architecture[/variant]
  
OS	                      Architectures Supported
Linux	                    amd64, arm, arm64, 386
Windows	                  amd64


Examples:
--platform Linux/arm64/v8
--platform Windows/amd64

✅ Use Cases for ACR Tasks
- CI/CD container pipelines without local Docker
- Auto-rebuild on base image patches (for better security posture)
- Cloud-native test pipelines using containers
- Build automation across multiple OS/architectures
