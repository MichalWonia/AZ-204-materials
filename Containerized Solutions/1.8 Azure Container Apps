🧱 What is Azure Container Apps?
Azure Container Apps is a serverless platform for running containerized applications and microservices on top of Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)—without having to manage the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure.

🚀 What You Can Do with Azure Container Apps
✅ Deploy microservices and APIs
✅ Run background tasks & event-driven apps
✅ Host scalable HTTP apps
✅ Support long-running or CPU-intensive workloads

⚙️ Key Features
- Serverless scaling via KEDA
  - Scale to zero on HTTP, events (e.g. queues, topics, timers)
  - Scale out based on CPU/memory (but these won’t scale to zero)
- HTTPS ingress automatically enabled
- Traffic splitting for:
  - Blue/Green deployments
-   A/B testing
- Internal-only endpoints using built-in DNS service discovery
- Native Dapr integration for:
  - Pub/sub
  - Service-to-service calls
  - Observability
  - Secrets and configuration
- Secrets management
- Run containers from any registry
- Monitor logs via Azure Log Analytics

🧩 Container Apps Environment
Think of an environment as a secure networked boundary where your container apps live.

📦 Apps in the same environment:
- Share a virtual network
- Use the same Log Analytics workspace
- Support internal communication (via DNS)
- Can share Dapr configuration

🛡️ Reasons to use different environments:
- To isolate apps that shouldn't share compute or network
- To block inter-app Dapr communication

🧬 Container Apps + Microservices
Container Apps is tailor-made for microservices:
- Scale individual services independently
- Use multiple versions of services at once
- Employ Dapr for service invocation, pub/sub, observability
- Ideal for event-driven systems or systems with decoupled components

💡 With Dapr, you get:
- Retry policies
- Timeouts
- TLS encryption between services
- Observability (tracing, logging, metrics)
- State management
- Secret management

🛠 Ways to Deploy/Manage
You can use:
- Azure CLI (az containerapp)
- Azure Portal
- ARM templates
- Bicep
- Terraform
- GitHub Actions / DevOps pipelines
