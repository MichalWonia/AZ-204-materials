🐳 What is Azure Container Registry (ACR)?
Azure Container Registry is a managed Docker registry service based on Docker Registry 2.0, allowing you to:
- Store and manage container images and artifacts (e.g., Docker images, Helm charts)
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- Automate builds and updates via ACR Tasks

🚀 Use Cases
You can push to and pull from ACR in your workflows, such as:
- Deploying containers to:
  - Kubernetes (AKS)
  - Azure App Service
  - Azure Batch
  - Service Fabric
- Automating CI/CD with:
  - Azure Pipelines
  - Jenkins
- ACR Tasks for:
  - Rebuilding images on code commits or base image updates
  - Multi-step builds (build → test → patch) in the cloud

📦 Service Tiers
Tier	                      Best For	                            Key Features
Basic	                      Learning / Low usage	                Full features but lower storage & throughput
Standard	                  Most production workloads	            More throughput & storage
Premium	                    High-volume enterprise scenarios	    Adds: Geo-replication, Content Trust, Private Link (VNET integration)

📁 Supported Images & Artifacts
- Docker-compatible images (Linux and Windows)
- Helm charts
- OCI Image Format support

Each image is a read-only snapshot stored in a repository within ACR.

🔄 Automated Builds with ACR Tasks
Use ACR Tasks to:
- Automate image builds when code is pushed to Git
- Automatically rebuild images when base images are updated
- Create multi-step build pipelines for:
  - Building
  - Testing
  - Deploying containers in parallel




🔐 Data Security & Redundancy
🔒 Encryption-at-Rest
- All data is encrypted before being stored (encryption-at-rest).
- Decryption happens automatically when images are pulled.
- Supports customer-managed keys (CMK) for added control.

🌍 Regional Storage
- Your data stays within the region where the registry is created.
- Paired-region redundancy (except in Brazil South and Southeast Asia where data is confined to meet strict residency laws).

🌐 Geo-replication (Premium Tier)
- Enables replication to multiple Azure regions.
- Benefits:
  - High availability during regional outages
  - Performance boost with region-local pulls/pushes for global teams

🌀 Zone Redundancy (Premium Tier)
- Uses Azure Availability Zones to replicate the registry within a region.
- Ensures resilience even if an entire zone fails.

🧱 Scalability
📦 Flexible Storage Limits
- No hard limits on:
  - Number of repositories
  - Number of images
  - Number of tags or layers

Bound only by the total storage quota of your registry tier.
Note: Large numbers of repositories and tags can affect performance. A regular cleanup routine is recommended.

🗑️ Registry Maintenance Tip
Periodically delete:
- Unused images
- Old tags
- Obsolete repositories

🔁 Remember: Once deleted, they cannot be recovered.
