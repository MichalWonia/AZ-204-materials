Container App Versioning and Revisions
- Revisions: Azure Container Apps uses revisions to implement versioning for container apps. 
A revision is an immutable snapshot of the container app at a particular version. Revisions allow you to:
  - Release new app versions.
  - Revert to previous versions.

- Creating Revisions: New revisions are created when you update your container app with changes that affect the 
revision scope (e.g., updates to the image, environment variables, scale parameters).
  - Revision names are unique by default and include a semi-random suffix, but you can customize the revision name using a revision suffix.
  - Example: album-api--1st-revision.

Managing Revisions
- Active Revisions: You can control which revisions are active and direct traffic to specific revisions.
- Commands for Revisions:
  - Use az containerapp update to update an app and create a new revision.
  - Use az containerapp revision list to list all revisions associated with an app.

Secrets Management
- Defining Secrets: Secrets are securely stored configuration values scoped to the application level and can be referenced in
environment variables within container apps.
  - Secrets are defined with the --secrets parameter, accepting name/value pairs, e.g., queue-connection-string=$CONNECTION_STRING.
- Referencing Secrets in Environment Variables: Secrets can be referenced in environment 
variables using the secretref: prefix, e.g., secretref:queue-connection-string.

Handling Secret Changes
- Effect on Revisions: Updating or deleting secrets doesn’t automatically affect existing revisions. You must:
  - Deploy a new revision or restart the current revision to reflect changes to secrets.
  - Ensure that secrets are not referenced in revisions before deletion.

Managed Identity for Secrets
- Key Vault Integration: Azure Container Apps doesn’t directly support Azure Key Vault integration. 
Instead, use managed identity to access Key Vault secrets in the app via the Key Vault SDK.

Key Points for the AZ-204 Exam:
- Understand the process of revision-based versioning and how to update/revert container apps.
- Know how to manage secrets in Azure Container Apps, including defining and referencing secrets.
- Be aware of the revision scope for secrets and how to respond to secret changes.
