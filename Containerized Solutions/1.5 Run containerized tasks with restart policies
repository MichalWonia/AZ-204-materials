🧪 ACI for Run-Once Tasks
🔄 Why use ACI?
- Super fast to spin up → no VM overhead
- Pay only for what you use (billed per second)
- Great for short-lived jobs:
  - Builds & tests
  - Image rendering
  - Scripted data processing
  - Cron-like scheduled tasks

🔁 Restart Policies in ACI
When launching a container group, you choose how containers should behave after they stop:

Policy	                      Behavior
Always (default)	            Restarts the container no matter what.
Never	                        Runs the container once only. Perfect for run-once tasks.
OnFailure	                    Restarts only if the container exits with an error (non-zero exit code).

📦 How to Set Restart Policy (CLI)
Use the --restart-policy flag when creating a container:
az container create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name mycontainer \
  --image mycontainerimage \
  --restart-policy OnFailure

✅ Run-to-Completion Behavior
- ACI will start the container.
- Once the task/script finishes, the container:
  - Stops automatically
  - Gets a status of Terminated (if Never or OnFailure)
- You're only billed while the container is running.
