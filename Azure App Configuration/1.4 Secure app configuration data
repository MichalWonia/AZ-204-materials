ðŸ”‘ Securing App Configuration Data
1. Customer-Managed Keys
By default, Azure App Configuration uses Microsoft-managed encryption keys to encrypt sensitive data (key-value pairs) at rest using AES 256-bit 
encryption. But if you want more control over the encryption process, you can use customer-managed keys (CMK).

ðŸ›  How It Works:
- Enable CMK to have Azure App Configuration use your Azure Key Vault for encryption.
- Managed Identity: The App Configuration instance uses a managed identity to authenticate with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Key Vault Integration: The managed identity accesses the Key Vault to wrap the encryption key. The wrapped key is stored in App Configuration, 
and the unwrapped version is cached for one hour.

ðŸŒŸ Required Setup:
1. App Configuration Standard Tier
2. Azure Key Vault with soft-delete and purge-protection enabled.
3. RSA Key in the Key Vault with wrap/unwrap permissions.
4. Assign Managed Identity to your App Configuration store.

2. Private Endpoints
Use private endpoints to ensure secure communication between your App Configuration store and your clients on a virtual network.

âœ… Benefits:
- No exposure to the public internetâ€”only accessible through private IPs.
- Increased security for your appâ€™s configuration data.
- Ideal for securely connecting on-premises networks to App Configuration over a VPN or ExpressRoute.

ðŸ”’ Private Link: Your data stays within Microsoftâ€™s backbone network, adding an additional layer of security to your configuration management.
3. Managed Identities
A managed identity simplifies secure access to Azure services like Azure Key Vault without needing to handle credentials. There are two types:

1. System-Assigned Identity:
- Tied to the App Configuration store and deleted if the store is deleted.
- Only one system-assigned identity per configuration store.

2. User-Assigned Identity:
- Standalone Azure resource that can be assigned to multiple stores.
- Greater flexibility in identity management.

ðŸ›  Setup with Azure CLI:
Assign a System-Assigned Identity:

az appconfig identity assign --name myTestAppConfigStore --resource-group myResourceGroup

Create and Assign a User-Assigned Identity:
1. Create a user-assigned identity:

az identity create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myUserAssignedIdentity

2. Assign the identity to App Configuration store:

az appconfig identity assign --name myTestAppConfigStore --resource-group myResourceGroup --identities /subscriptions/[subscription id]/resourcegroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.ManagedIdentity/userAssignedIdentities/myUserAssignedIdentity

ðŸ›¡ Summary of Securing Your Configuration Data
- Customer-managed keys for complete control over encryption.
- Private endpoints to ensure secure, private connections.
- Managed identities to avoid handling secrets while accessing Azure resources.

With these security measures, your configuration data is well-protected from unauthorized access, ensuring data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
