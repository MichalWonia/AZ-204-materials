🎯 What is Feature Management?
Feature management lets you control feature availability dynamically without deploying new code. 
You do this using feature flags (also called toggles or switches).

🔧 Key Concepts
Term	                                Description
Feature Flag	                        A Boolean variable (on/off) that controls whether a feature's code runs.
Feature Manager	                      Manages feature flags (loading, caching, evaluating).
Filter	                              A rule that decides whether a flag is on. (e.g., based on % of users, geolocation, user role, etc.)

🧪 Feature Flag in Code (C# Example)
🔹 Basic usage:

if (featureFlag) {
    // Feature-specific logic
}

🔹 Conditional logic:

bool featureFlag = isBetaUser();

if (featureFlag) {
    // Show new UI
} else {
    // Show old UI
}

🗂 Managing Feature Flags with Azure App Configuration
Instead of hardcoding flags, store them centrally and retrieve dynamically:

📁 JSON config example (for local or App Configuration):

"FeatureManagement": {
  "FeatureA": true,
  "FeatureB": false,
  "FeatureC": {
    "EnabledFor": [
      {
        "Name": "Percentage",
        "Parameters": {
          "Value": 50
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}

- FeatureA is always ON.
- FeatureB is always OFF.
- FeatureC is ON for 50% of users (randomly determined).

🧠 Why use Azure App Configuration?
✅ Central place to manage feature flags
✅ Supports advanced filters (e.g., % rollouts, targeting by user group)
✅ Secure and scalable
✅ No redeployment needed to change a flag
✅ Works seamlessly with the Feature Management library in .NET and other platforms

🪄 Bonus: Real-World Use Cases
- Soft launch new features to 10% of users
- Roll out features by region or user role
- Quickly disable buggy features in production
- Enable A/B testing scenarios
