🧩 App Configuration vs. Azure Key Vault
App Configuration	                              Azure Key Vault
Stores app settings & feature flags	            Stores secrets, certificates, keys
Great for toggles, versions, labels	            Best for sensitive values like passwords
Dynamic updates	                                Secure access control
Use both for full config + secrets management!
