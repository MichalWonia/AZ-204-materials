üì¶ What is Azure Queue Storage?
Azure Queue Storage provides a simple message queuing system for large-scale, asynchronous communication between application components. 
It‚Äôs great for building backlogs of work to be processed in the background.

üß± Key Components:
Component	                          Description
Storage Account	                    The top-level container that holds all your Azure storage resources (queues, blobs, etc.).
Queue	                              A named container for messages (must be lowercase).
Message	                            A string (or other serialized format) of up to 64 KB. Stored in the queue.

üåê Access Format
Queues are accessible via:

https://<storage-account-name>.queue.core.windows.net/<queue-name>
Example:

https://myaccount.queue.core.windows.net/images-to-download
