📦 Service Bus Messaging Entities Overview:
✅ Queues
- FIFO delivery to a single consumer at a time.
- Messages are stored durably → producers and consumers don’t need to be online at the same time.
- Supports load leveling and loose coupling between services.
- Can be created using Portal, CLI, PowerShell, ARM templates.

🔁 Receive Modes:
Mode	                        Description	                                            Use Case
ReceiveAndDelete	          Message is removed as soon as received	                Use when occasional message loss is acceptable
PeekLock	                    Two-step receive: lock then complete or abandon	        Use when you must not lose messages

📣 Topics & Subscriptions (Pub/Sub)
- Use topics to support 1-to-many communication.
- Each subscription gets a copy of each message sent to the topic.
- Consumers receive messages from subscriptions, not directly from topics.
- Supports:
  - Load balancing
  - Temporal decoupling
  - Competing consumers
  - Load leveling (like queues)

🎯 Rules and Actions
- Let you filter and modify messages at the subscription level.
- Use filters (e.g., SQL filters) to control which messages a subscription receives.
- Use actions to modify message properties (like tags/labels).
- Supports both system properties (like Label) and custom properties (like StoreName).

🧠 Exam Tips:
- Queues = point-to-point, single consumer per message.
- Topics = pub/sub, multiple subscribers per message.
- Know how to use Peek Lock for reliable processing.
- Understand filters/actions to route or transform messages intelligently.
- Subscriptions behave like virtual queues.
