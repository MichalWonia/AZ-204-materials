✅ Use Service Bus Queues when:
- Low latency message delivery without polling is needed (via long-polling on TCP).
- FIFO (First-In, First-Out) message order is required.
- Duplicate message detection is necessary.
- You need to process messages as sessions or streams (using SessionId to group related messages).
- Transactional operations (send/receive multiple messages atomically) are required.
- You need to support larger message sizes (over 64 KB, up to 100 MB depending on tier).
- Role-based access control (RBAC) and fine-grained permissions are needed.

✅ Use Storage Queues when:
- You need to store more than 80 GB of messages.
- Your application needs to track processing progress (useful if a worker crashes mid-processing).
- You require server-side logging for all transactions on the queue.

🧠 Key AZ-204 Exam Tips:
- Service Bus = rich features, more control, better for complex workflows or enterprise apps.
- Storage Queue = simple, scalable, cost-effective, better for large storage and basic queuing needs.
