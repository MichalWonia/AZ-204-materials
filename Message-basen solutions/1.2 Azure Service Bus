üöÄ What is Azure Service Bus?
- A fully managed enterprise message broker.
- Supports message queues (point-to-point) and topics/subscriptions (publish/subscribe).
- Used to decouple applications, improving scalability and reliability.
- Messages contain data (JSON, XML, Avro, plain text) and metadata.

üß© Common Use Cases:
- Messaging: Transfer business data (orders, logs, etc.).
- Decoupling services: Sender and receiver don‚Äôt need to be online at the same time.
- Topics/Subscribers: 1-to-many message distribution.
- Message Sessions: Maintain FIFO or implement workflows requiring ordering.
