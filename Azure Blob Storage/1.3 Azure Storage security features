Azure Storage Encryption üõ°Ô∏è
- Service-Side Encryption (SSE)
- Encryption at rest: Automatically encrypts data when stored in Azure Storage.
- 256-bit AES: Uses one of the strongest encryption standards (AES-256) to protect data.
- Transparent encryption: No code changes required for encryption.
- Supports all Azure Storage services: Blob, Table, Queue, File Storage, etc.
- No extra cost for encryption.

Key Management üîë
- Microsoft-managed keys: Default option, with Microsoft handling encryption/decryption.
- Customer-managed keys: You can manage encryption keys via Azure Key Vault (for Blob Storage and Azure Files).
- Customer-provided keys: Allow granular control over encryption/decryption with an encryption key supplied by the client.
- Key storage: Keys are stored either by Microsoft, in Azure Key Vault, or your own key store.

Client-Side Encryption üíª
- Encrypt data before upload: Supported in .NET, Java, and Python client libraries for Blob and Queue Storage.
- AES encryption: Both AES in CBC mode (version 1) and GCM mode (version 2) are supported for encryption.
