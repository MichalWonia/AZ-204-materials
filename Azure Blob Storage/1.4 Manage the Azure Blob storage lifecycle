Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle 🔄
Access Tiers 📊
- Hot: Optimized for frequent access.
- Cool: For infrequently accessed data stored for 30+ days.
- Cold: For rarely accessed data stored for 90+ days, with higher access costs.
- Archive: For rarely accessed data, stored for 180+ days with high latency but lowest storage cost.

Managing Data Lifecycle ⏳
Lifecycle management allows you to:
- Transition blobs to more cost-effective tiers (e.g., Hot to Cool/Cold).
- Expire and delete blobs that are no longer needed.
- Apply policies based on conditions like access frequency or blob age.

Scenario Example 🔄
- Frequent access initially → Use Hot tier.
- Infrequent access after two weeks → Move to Cool tier.
- Rarely accessed beyond a month → Move to Archive tier.

Using these tiers and lifecycle management rules can optimize cost while ensuring your data stays accessible based on its age and usage frequency.
