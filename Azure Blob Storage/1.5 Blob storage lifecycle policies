Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Policies üìú
Lifecycle management in Azure Blob Storage involves creating rules that automatically move blobs to different access tiers or delete them based on certain conditions. 
Each rule consists of a filter set (which defines which blobs the rule applies to) and an action set (which defines what happens to the selected blobs).

Policy Structure üìë
A policy is a collection of rules, written in JSON format. Each rule has:
- Name: A unique identifier for the rule.
- Enabled: A boolean to activate or deactivate the rule.
- Type: Currently, only "Lifecycle" is valid.
- Definition: Specifies the filter and action sets.

Sample Rule (JSON Format):
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "sample-rule",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30 },
            "tierToArchive": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 90, "daysAfterLastTierChangeGreaterThan": 7 },
            "delete": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 2555 }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["sample-container/blob1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}


Rule Filters üîç
Filters define which blobs are targeted for actions. The filters work as an AND condition when combined. Available filters include:
- blobTypes: Defines the blob types (e.g., blockBlob, appendBlob).
- prefixMatch: Matches blob names based on prefixes (e.g., "sample-container/blob1").
- blobIndexMatch: Allows filtering by index tags attached to blobs.

Actions üí•
Actions are what happen to the blobs that match the filters. For example:
- Tiering:
 - tierToCool: Moves to Cool tier after 30 days of no modification.
 - tierToArchive: Moves to Archive tier after 90 days of no modification (and 7+ days in Cool/Cold).
 - tierToCold: Moves to Cold tier after 90 days.

- Deletion:
 - delete: Deletes blobs after 2,555 days (~7 years).

- Snapshots:
 - delete (for snapshots) after 90 days.

Action Conditions ‚è≥
The conditions that trigger actions are:
- daysAfterModificationGreaterThan: Time in days since the last modification for base blobs.
- daysAfterCreationGreaterThan: Time in days since the creation of blob snapshots.
- daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan: Time since the last access (if access tracking is enabled).
- daysAfterLastTierChangeGreaterThan: Time since the last tier change before moving blobs back to Archive.

Cost-Effective Action Application üí∏
Lifecycle management applies the least expensive action when multiple actions are available. For example:
- Delete is cheaper than tierToArchive, and tierToArchive is cheaper than tierToCool.

This lifecycle management system ensures that blobs are stored in the most cost-effective tier according to their access frequency and lifecycle stage. 
You can automate data transitions based on age, helping to optimize storage costs.
