What is Azure Event Hubs?
Azure Event Hubs is a fully managed, cloud-native data streaming service designed for high-throughput, low-latency event streaming. 
It can handle millions of events per second from various sources to multiple destinations, providing a 
robust platform for real-time analytics and processing.

Event Hubs enables real-time ingestion, buffering, and processing of streaming data, with support for industry-standard protocols like Apache Kafka, 
AMQP, and HTTPS.

Key Capabilities of Azure Event Hubs
1. Apache Kafka Compatibility
Event Hubs supports Apache Kafka, meaning you can run existing Kafka workloads on Event Hubs without needing to make code changes. 
This allows you to move your Kafka-based solutions to Azure without rearchitecting your application.
- No need for managing your own Kafka cluster.
- Event Hubs provides a fully managed, scalable Kafka service natively on Azure.

2. Schema Registry
The Schema Registry in Event Hubs provides a centralized repository for managing schemas of event streaming applications. 
This ensures that the event data being streamed adheres to a consistent structure, reducing data quality issues.
- Free with every Event Hubs namespace.
- Integrates seamlessly with both Kafka and Event Hubs SDK-based applications.

3. Real-Time Processing with Stream Analytics
Event Hubs integrates with Azure Stream Analytics for real-time processing of event streams. 
You can process your data streams in real time using the built-in no-code editor or write SQL queries to analyze the data.
- No-code Editor: Drag-and-drop functionality for building Stream Analytics jobs.
- SQL-based Querying: Developers can use the SQL-like query language for stream processing.

4. High-Throughput and Low Latency
Event Hubs is designed for high throughput, handling millions of events per second with low-latency processing. 
It provides scalability to accommodate large volumes of streaming data.

Key Concepts of Azure Event Hubs
1. Producer Applications
Producer applications are responsible for ingesting events into Event Hubs using the Event Hubs SDKs or Kafka producer clients.
These applications push data to the event hub or Kafka topic.

2. Namespace
A namespace serves as a container for one or more event hubs or Kafka topics. At the namespace level, you manage:
- Streaming capacity
- Network security configurations
- Geo-disaster recovery setups

3. Event Hubs/Kafka Topic
An Event Hub or Kafka topic organizes events into an append-only distributed log. Events are streamed into partitions,
which allow for scalability and parallel processing.

4. Partitions
Partitions are used to scale an Event Hub. Think of them as lanes on a freeway—more partitions allow for higher throughput 
and better parallelization of data processing.

5. Consumer Applications
Consumer applications read data from the event hub by seeking through the event log and maintaining their consumer offset. 
These can be either Kafka consumer clients or Event Hubs SDK clients.

6. Consumer Group
A consumer group is a logical grouping of consumer instances that read the same streaming data independently at their
own pace and with their own offsets. This allows multiple consumers to process data concurrently without interfering with each other.

Key Benefits
- High Throughput: Can handle millions of events per second, making it suitable for large-scale applications.
- Scalability: Partitioned model enables efficient scaling based on the volume of data.
- Integration: Integrates seamlessly with Azure services like Stream Analytics, Functions, and Storage, and can be used 
with third-party systems through Kafka compatibility.
- Real-Time Processing: Supports real-time data processing, which is critical for applications like monitoring, telemetry, and log aggregation.

Use Cases
- IoT (Internet of Things): Collecting and processing telemetry data from IoT devices in real-time.
- Log and Event Aggregation: Ingesting logs and events from multiple sources, such as applications, servers, and cloud services.
- Real-Time Analytics: Analyzing streams of data for fraud detection, monitoring, and other real-time use cases.
- Stream Processing: Using Azure Stream Analytics or custom applications to process and analyze event data.
