What is an API Gateway?
An API gateway sits between clients and backend services, acting as a reverse proxy that routes client requests to the appropriate services. It is responsible for handling several essential tasks:
- Routing requests: Directs client requests to the correct backend service.
- Cross-cutting tasks: Handles common concerns such as authentication, SSL termination, rate limiting, and logging.
- Decoupling services: Clients don’t need to know the specifics of each service or handle failures related to backend services. The gateway abstracts this complexity.

Benefits of an API Gateway
Without an API gateway, clients would need to interact directly with backend services, leading to several potential issues:
1. Complex client code: Clients would need to track multiple service endpoints and manage failure scenarios.
2. Tight coupling: Clients are closely tied to backend services, making it harder to refactor services or change architecture.
3. Service orchestration: Some operations may need calls to multiple services, which clients would need to manage.
4. Security and concerns management: Each service would need to handle concerns like authentication, SSL, and rate limiting.
5. Limited communication protocols: Services must expose client-friendly protocols like HTTP or WebSocket.

The API gateway simplifies these complexities by managing cross-cutting concerns centrally, reducing the workload on both the client and backend services.

Managed vs. Self-hosted Gateways
Managed Gateway:
- Default gateway deployed in Azure with every API Management instance.
- Azure-hosted: All traffic flows through Azure, regardless of where the backend services are located.
- Best for: Most cloud-based scenarios, as it reduces management complexity.

Self-hosted Gateway:
- Containerized version of the managed gateway.
- Best for hybrid and multi-cloud scenarios, where API backends are hosted in different environments (on-premises or across multiple clouds).
- Allows management of APIs hosted both on-premises and across clouds from a single Azure API Management service.

Why Use an API Gateway?
- Decouples clients from services: Clients only need to communicate with the gateway, not individual services.
- Centralized security: Authentication, SSL termination, rate limiting, and other security measures are managed in one place.
- Simplifies client code: Clients don’t need to manage multiple endpoints or service-specific concerns.
- Scalability and flexibility: You can scale backend services independently without impacting clients.

By using an API gateway, you can manage the complexity of multiple services, handle security, and ensure that clients are abstracted from backend service changes. 
This is a crucial part of modern microservices architectures.
