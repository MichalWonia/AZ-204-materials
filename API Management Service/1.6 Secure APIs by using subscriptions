Securing APIs with Subscriptions and Subscription Keys
When publishing APIs through API Management, it is essential to secure access using subscription keys. 
These keys help ensure that only authorized users can access your API. Here's a breakdown of how subscriptions and keys function:

1. What is a Subscription?
A subscription is a container for a pair of subscription keys (primary and secondary) used to access one or more APIs. 
The subscription key ensures that only authorized developers can call your API.
- Subscription Key: A unique key automatically generated for each subscription.
- Primary and Secondary Keys: Each subscription has two keys to provide redundancy.
For example, you can regenerate the primary key without causing downtime by using the secondary key.

2. Subscription Scopes
Subscriptions in Azure API Management can be scoped in three main ways:
- All APIs: The subscription applies to all APIs in the API Management instance.
- Single API: The subscription is scoped to a single API and all its endpoints.
- Product: A product is a collection of one or more APIs. 
You can assign APIs to different products, and each product can have its own access rules, usage quotas, and terms of use.

This granular control allows API publishers to limit access based on the scope of the subscription (e.g., to a specific API or product).

3. How to Use Subscription Keys
- To call an API, the client application must include a valid subscription key in every request.
- The subscription key can be included either in the HTTP request header or as a query string.

Header Example:

curl --header "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <key string>" https://<apim gateway>.azure-api.net/api/path
Query String Example:

curl https://<apim gateway>.azure-api.net/api/path?subscription-key=<key string>
If the key is not provided in the correct format (header or query string), the request will return a 401 Access Denied response from the API gateway.

4. Regenerating Subscription Keys
- You can regenerate subscription keys at any time, for example, if you suspect a key has been compromised.
- Having two keys (primary and secondary) ensures that you can rotate keys without downtime by using the secondary key in 
your applications when regenerating the primary key.

5. Additional Security Mechanisms
While subscription keys are a common way to secure access, Azure API Management also supports other security mechanisms, such as:
- OAuth 2.0: For token-based authentication and authorization.
- Client Certificates: For securing API access using certificates.
- IP Allow Listing: To restrict access to APIs based on specific IP addresses.

Key Takeaways:
- Subscription keys are used to secure APIs, ensuring that only authorized developers can access your APIs.
- Keys can be included in either the request header (Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key) or as a query string (subscription-key).
- Subscriptions can be scoped at three levels: All APIs, Single API, or Product.
- You can regenerate subscription keys without downtime by using primary and secondary keys.
- Other security methods like OAuth, client certificates, and IP allow listing can be used in conjunction with subscription keys.

This subscription-based security model helps ensure that your API is protected and accessible only to authorized users.
