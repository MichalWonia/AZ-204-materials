1. Control Flow
The control flow policy allows you to conditionally apply policies based on the evaluation of boolean expressions. It works similarly to a switch or if-else structure in programming.

Example:

<choose>
  <when condition="Boolean expression | Boolean constant">
    <!-- One or more policy statements to be applied if condition is true -->
  </when>
  <when condition="Boolean expression | Boolean constant">
    <!-- One or more policy statements to be applied if condition is true -->
  </when>
  <otherwise>
    <!-- One or more policy statements to be applied if all conditions are false -->
  </otherwise>
</choose>

- <when>: Defines conditions to apply policies if the condition evaluates as true.
- <otherwise>: Optional. Defines actions if none of the conditions are met.

2. Forward Request
The forward-request policy forwards the incoming request to the backend service specified in the request context.

Example:

<forward-request timeout="time in seconds" follow-redirects="true | false"/>

- timeout: Defines the maximum time allowed for the request to be forwarded to the backend.
- follow-redirects: Specifies whether the request should follow any redirects from the backend.

3. Limit Concurrency
The limit-concurrency policy limits the number of concurrent requests that can execute at the same time. If more requests are received, they will be immediately rejected with a 429 Too Many Requests status.

Example:

<limit-concurrency key="expression" max-count="number">
  <!-- Nested policy statements -->
</limit-concurrency>

- key: The key used to group requests.
- max-count: The maximum number of requests allowed to execute concurrently.

4. Log to Event Hub
The log-to-eventhub policy sends logs in the specified format to an Event Hub defined by a logger entity.

Example:

<log-to-eventhub logger-id="id of the logger entity" partition-id="index of the partition where messages are sent" partition-key="value used for partition assignment">
  Expression returning a string to be logged
</log-to-eventhub>

- logger-id: ID of the logger entity.
- partition-id: Index of the partition in the Event Hub.
- partition-key: Value for partition assignment.

5. Mock Response
The mock-response policy is used to return a mocked response directly to the caller. This policy is useful for simulating API behavior when actual backend services aren’t available.

Example:

<mock-response status-code="code" content-type="media type"/>

- status-code: The HTTP status code to return.
- content-type: The media type for the mock response (e.g., application/json).

6. Retry
The retry policy retries execution of enclosed policies until a specific condition becomes false, or a maximum retry count is reached.

Example:

<retry condition="boolean expression or literal"
       count="number of retry attempts"
       interval="retry interval in seconds"
       max-interval="maximum retry interval in seconds"
       delta="retry interval delta in seconds"
       first-fast-retry="boolean expression or literal">
  <!-- One or more child policies -->
</retry>

- condition: The condition that determines when to retry.
- count: The number of retry attempts.
- interval: The retry interval in seconds.
- max-interval: The maximum time between retries.
- delta: The interval change between retries.
- first-fast-retry: A boolean expression that decides if the first retry should be fast.

7. Return Response
The return-response policy immediately aborts pipeline execution and returns a custom response to the caller. You can either return a default response or a response based on a context variable or policy statement.

Example:

<return-response response-variable-name="existing context variable">
  <set-header/>
  <set-body/>
  <set-status/>
</return-response>

- response-variable-name: The name of the context variable that holds the response to return.
- set-header, set-body, set-status: Modify the returned response.

Key Takeaways:
- Control flow: Allows conditional application of policies (like if/else).
- Forward request: Forwards requests to backend services.
- Limit concurrency: Prevents more than a certain number of requests from executing at once.
- Log to Event Hub: Logs data to an Event Hub for later analysis.
- Mock response: Simulates responses without hitting the backend.
- Retry: Retries policy execution if certain conditions aren't met.
- Return response: Immediately returns a custom response, aborting the pipeline.

These policies help you manage your API’s behavior under different scenarios, allowing you to ensure better control, testing, and error handling in your API ecosystem.
