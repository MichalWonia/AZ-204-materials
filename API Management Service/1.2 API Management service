Key Components of Azure API Management
1. API Gateway:
- Handles API calls and routes them to appropriate backend services.
- Validates API keys and other credentials.
- Enforces policies like rate limits, caching, and transformations.
- Provides logs and metrics for monitoring API performance.

2. Management Plane:
- The administrative interface for configuring and managing the API Management service.
- Define and import API schemas.
- Package APIs into products.
- Set up policies like quotas or transformations.
- Access analytics to gain insights into API usage.
- Manage users and permissions.

3. Developer Portal:
- Automatically generated and customizable website for developers.
- Developers can read API documentation, test APIs, and subscribe to APIs.
- Provides a console for testing APIs and managing API keys.
- Developers can view usage analytics and download API definitions.

Important Concepts
1. Products:
- APIs are grouped into products, which are presented to developers.
- Products can be either Open (no subscription required) or Protected (requires subscription approval).
- Subscription approval can either be automatic or manual by the administrator.

2. Groups:
- System groups help manage access and visibility:
  - Administrators: Manage the service.
  - Developers: Build apps using APIs.
  - Guests: View APIs without calling them.
- Custom groups can be created or integrated with external systems like Microsoft Entra.

3. Developers:
- Developers can be invited by admins or sign up via the Developer Portal.
- Developers subscribe to products that allow them to access specific APIs.

4. Policies:
- Policies are rules applied to incoming requests or outgoing responses, such as rate limiting or format transformations (e.g., XML to JSON).
- Policies are executed sequentially.
- Policies can be applied globally, or at more granular levels like on a specific API or operation.

Key Benefits of API Management
- Security: Enforces API security using keys, policies, and rate limiting.
- Engagement: Developer portal helps with API documentation and engagement.
- Analytics: Provides insights into API usage and performance.
- Scalability: Allows you to manage multiple APIs and products efficiently.
- Customization: Policies can be tailored for specific needs at various levels.
