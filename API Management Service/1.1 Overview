API Management Overview
Azure API Management provides all the core functionalities for managing, securing, and monitoring APIs. 
It allows you to engage developers, gain business insights, and ensure the safety and scalability of your APIs.
Here's a breakdown of its key components and features:

API Management Components
1. API Gateway:
- Acts as the entry point for API calls.
- Verifies credentials like API keys.
- Enforces policies like rate limiting or quotas.
- Transforms requests/responses (e.g., from XML to JSON).
- Caches responses for better performance.
- Provides detailed logs and metrics for monitoring.

2. Management Plane:
- The administrative interface for managing your API program.
- Here, you can:
  - Provision the API Management service.
  - Define APIs and their operations.
  - Set up policies like security and throttling.
  - Get analytics and manage users.

3. Developer Portal:
- Automatically generated and customizable portal for developers.
- Read API documentation, test APIs, and subscribe to APIs.
- Developers can view analytics on their usage and manage their API keys.
- Interactive Console: Developers can test APIs directly from the portal.

Products in API Management
- What Are Products?
  - A product is a way to package APIs and surface them to developers.
  - A product can contain one or more APIs.
  - Each product has:
    - Title and description
    - Terms of use
    - Visibility control (open vs protected)
  - Product Types:
    - Open Products: Can be used without needing a subscription.
    - Protected Products: Requires developers to subscribe to gain access.
  - Subscription Approval:
    - Manual approval by the administrator or auto-approval based on the product's configuration.

Groups in API Management
- Purpose: Groups help manage visibility and access to products for developers.

- System Groups:
  - Administrators: Manage the API Management service and configuration.
  - Developers: Authenticated users who create apps using APIs.
  - Guests: Unauthenticated users with read-only access to APIs.

- Custom Groups:
  - You can create custom groups or integrate with external groups from Microsoft Entra.

Policies in API Management
- What Are Policies?
  - Policies are rules or configurations that are executed sequentially on incoming requests and outgoing responses.
  - Common policy types include:
    - Rate Limiting: Restricting the number of requests from a developer.
    - Format Transformation: Changing data formats (e.g., from XML to JSON).
    - Security: Applying authentication or authorization checks.

Policy Scopes:
- Policies can be applied at various levels:
    - Global: Applies to all APIs.
    - Product: Applies to all APIs within the product.
    - API: Applies to a specific API.
    - Operation: Applies to a specific operation within an API.

Policy Expressions:
  - You can use expressions in policies for dynamic content, such as manipulating request headers, data transformation, or implementing conditional logic.

Summary of Key Concepts:
- API Gateway: Entry point for API calls, manages security, traffic, and logging.
- Management Plane: Administrative interface for managing your API program.
- Developer Portal: Customizable interface for developers to explore, test, and manage APIs.
- Products: Package APIs into products, control visibility, and manage subscriptions.
- Groups: Organize developers and control access to products.
- Policies: Rules for handling requests and responses, ensuring security and compliance.
