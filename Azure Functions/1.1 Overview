💡 What is Azure Functions?
Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that:
- lets you run code without managing servers.
- reduces the need for heavy infrastructure maintenance.
- helps save costs by scaling automatically based on demand.
- ensures your app always runs on up-to-date cloud infrastructure.

⚙️ When to Use Azure Functions
Use Azure Functions for apps that react to events—great for building:
- Web APIs
- Database triggers (respond to data changes)
- IoT data processing
- Queue/message processing
- Basically, any scenario where actions are triggered by events

🔁 Core Concepts
Azure Functions are powered by two main building blocks:

✅ Triggers
Define how your function is started.

Examples:
- HTTP request
- Timer (e.g., every 5 minutes)
- Queue/message received
- Blob/file uploaded
- Database update

📦 Bindings
- Make it easier to connect to data sources and outputs.
- Automatically handle input/output so you write less boilerplate code.
- Example: Read from a queue and write directly to a database with minimal code.

🔗 Integration & Automation
Azure Functions work well alongside other Azure integration services.
These services help automate workflows by defining:
- Inputs
- Actions
- Conditions
- Outputs

Examples include Logic Apps, Power Automate, Event Grid, etc.

In short: Azure Functions = Event-driven + Serverless + Scalable + Cost-efficient




⚔️ Azure Functions vs. Azure Logic Apps
Both are serverless services in Azure, but they serve different purposes and suit different kinds of users.

🧠 Key Differences
Feature	                  Azure Functions	                                  Azure Logic Apps
Type	                    Serverless compute service	                      Serverless workflow integration platform
Development Style	        Code-first (C#, JavaScript, Python, etc.)	        Low-code/no-code via GUI or config files (JSON)
Orchestrations	          Built using Durable Functions extension	          Built using actions and triggers in a visual designer
Best For	                Developers comfortable with coding	              Power users, IT pros, or devs wanting visual workflows
Flexibility	              Highly customizable through code	                Fast to build, easier to integrate multiple services

🔄 What Is Orchestration?
Orchestration = A series of steps/functions to complete a complex task.
- Azure Functions: You orchestrate by writing and chaining code.
- Logic Apps: You orchestrate using a drag-and-drop designer or editing JSON.

🛠️ When to Use Which?
Use Case	                                                                  Go With...
You need deep customization and control	                                    Azure Functions
You want to integrate services quickly (e.g., Outlook + SQL + Teams)	      Logic Apps
You prefer coding	                                                          Azure Functions
You prefer GUI-based workflow building	                                    Logic Apps

🧩 Common Ground
- Both support event-driven architecture.
- Both can scale automatically.
- Both are great for automation, integrations, and workflows.

Azure Durable Functions:
The primary use case for Durable Functions is simplifying complex, stateful coordination requirements in serverless applications. 
The following sections describe typical application patterns that can benefit from Durable Functions:
- Function chaining
- Fan-out/fan-in
- Async HTTP APIs
- Monitoring
- Human interaction
- Aggregator (stateful entities)
