Consumption Plan	                                Event-driven; automatically scales out based on incoming trigger events.	                Windows: 200
                                                                                                                                            Linux: 100
  
Flex Consumption Plan	                            Per-function scaling; scales based on individual function demands.	                      Limited by total memory usage across instances in a region.

Premium Plan	                                    Event-driven; scales out automatically based on event triggers.	                          Windows: 100
                                                                                                                                            Linux: 20–100

Dedicated Plan	                                  Manual or autoscale; scaling depends on the App Service plan configuration.	              10–30
                                                                                                                                            100 in an App Service Environment (ASE)

Container Apps	                                  Event-driven; scales out by adding more Function host instances based on event triggers.	10–300

Notes:
Linux Consumption plan apps have a scale-out limit of 500 instances per subscription per hour.​
In certain regions, Linux apps on a Premium plan can scale up to 100 instances.​
In Container Apps, the maximum number of replicas can be set, subject to available core quotas.​
