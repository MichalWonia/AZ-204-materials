🔹Function App Basics
- A function app is the execution context for Azure Functions — it's the unit of deployment, scaling, and management.

- A function app can contain multiple functions, and they share the same:
- Pricing plan
- Deployment method
- Runtime version

🧠 In Azure Functions v2.x and later, all functions in a function app must be written in the same language.

🔹 Local Development
- You can develop and test Azure Functions locally using your preferred code editor.
- Local functions can connect to live Azure services and be debugged using the full Functions runtime.
- It's recommended to develop locally and then publish to Azure, due to limitations in the portal editor.

📁 Function App Project Files
A typical Functions project (regardless of language) contains:
- host.json	-- Global configuration for all functions in the app
- local.settings.json	-- Stores local app settings for development; not used in Azure deployment
⚠️ Do not commit local.settings.json to version control — it may contain secrets like connection strings.

🔄 Settings Synchronization
- Any app settings used locally must also be set in Azure when publishing.
- You can also download settings from your deployed function app to your local project to stay in sync.
