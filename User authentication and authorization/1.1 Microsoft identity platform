Overview of the Microsoft Identity Platform
The Microsoft Identity Platform enables you to build applications that allow users to sign in using various identity types, including personal Microsoft accounts, 
work or school accounts, and social or local accounts. It also provides authorized access to APIs such as Microsoft Graph and your own custom APIs.

Key Components of the Microsoft Identity Platform
1. OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:
- Standard-compliant authentication service.
- Supports various identity types including:
  - Work or school accounts (via Microsoft Entra ID).
  - Personal Microsoft accounts (e.g., Skype, Xbox, Outlook.com).
  - Social or local accounts (via Azure Active Directory B2C).
  - Customer accounts (via Microsoft Entra External ID).

2. Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL):
- Open-source libraries to help with authentication.
- Supports other standards-compliant libraries for integrating authentication in apps.

3. Microsoft Identity Platform Endpoint:
- Works with MSAL or any other standards-compliant library.
- Uses human-readable scopes in line with industry standards to request permissions and access tokens.

4. Application Management Portal:
- Accessible through the Azure portal for registering and configuring applications.
- Integrates with Azure management tools for easy app management.

5. Application Configuration API and PowerShell:
- Allows programmatic configuration of applications using Microsoft Graph API or PowerShell.
- Helps automate DevOps tasks and app configuration.

Innovations in Identity and Security
- Passwordless Authentication: Enables users to sign in without a password.
- Step-up Authentication: Requires users to authenticate with additional factors under certain conditions.
- Conditional Access: Enforces access policies based on user context (e.g., location, device compliance).
- Native Integration: Applications integrated with the Microsoft identity platform automatically take advantage of these modern identity and security features.
