In MSAL.NET 3.x, the preferred approach for initializing both public and confidential client applications is to use application builders: PublicClientApplicationBuilder and ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder. 
These builders provide a flexible way to configure your application, whether directly in the code, through configuration files, or even a combination of both approaches.

Before initializing an application, you'll need to register the application with the Microsoft identity platform through the Azure portal. After registration, you will typically need the following details:
- Application (client) ID: A GUID identifying your application.
- Directory (tenant) ID: Specifies the Azure Active Directory (AAD) tenant. It’s important for specifying whether the app is single-tenant or multi-tenant.
- Identity provider URL (Authority): Defines where the authentication happens and specifies the audience and tenant.
- Client credentials: For confidential apps, this could be either a client secret or an X509 certificate.
- Redirect URI: Required for web apps and sometimes public apps (especially if using a broker for authentication).

Code Examples for Initializing Applications
Public Client Application
Public client apps typically don’t have a client secret, and they authenticate users interactively. Here’s how to instantiate a public client application using PublicClientApplicationBuilder:

IPublicClientApplication app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .Build();
    
Confidential Client Application
For confidential client applications (e.g., web apps), you need to provide a client secret or certificate. 
Below is an example of initializing a confidential client application, such as a web app located at https://myapp.azurewebsites.net:

string redirectUri = "https://myapp.azurewebsites.net";
IConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)  // Or use .WithCertificate(certificate)
    .WithRedirectUri(redirectUri)
    .Build();

    
Modifiers in the Application Builders
Both public and confidential client applications have several useful modifiers that can be applied to configure the app further. Below are some common and specific modifiers.

Common Modifiers for Both Client Types
- .WithAuthority(): Defines the authority (tenant, audience, or the full URI). You can use it to specify whether the application targets Azure Public Cloud, Azure China, Azure Government, etc.

app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, tenantId)
    .Build();
    
- .WithTenantId(): Specifies or overrides the tenant ID.

app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithTenantId(tenantId)
    .Build();
    
- .WithClientId(): Overrides the default client ID (if needed).

app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithClientId(newClientId)
    .Build();
    
- .WithRedirectUri(): Used to override the default redirect URI. Useful for scenarios involving brokers.

app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithRedirectUri("http://localhost")
    .Build();
    
- .WithComponent(): Sets the name of the library using MSAL.NET for telemetry reasons.

app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithComponent("MyApp")
    .Build();
    
- .WithDebugLoggingCallback(): Enables debug-level logging, useful for debugging and tracing.

app = PublicClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithDebugLoggingCallback()
    .Build();

- .WithLogging(): Allows you to configure a callback to handle logging and debug traces.
- .WithTelemetry(): Sets up telemetry by providing a delegate that handles telemetry events.


Modifiers Specific to Confidential Client Applications
Confidential client applications require additional configuration, particularly in terms of how they authenticate and maintain secure credentials. Some common modifiers for confidential clients:
- .WithClientSecret(string clientSecret): Specifies the client secret used to authenticate the application with the identity provider.

app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .Build();
    
- .WithCertificate(X509Certificate2 certificate): Use an X509 certificate as the client credential instead of a client secret.

app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithCertificate(certificate)
    .Build();
    
Important:
- Mutually Exclusive: The .WithClientSecret() and .WithCertificate() methods are mutually exclusive. You cannot provide both in a single instance. If both are provided, MSAL.NET will throw an exception.

Example of Full Confidential Client Initialization:

IConfidentialClientApplication app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId)
    .WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
    .WithRedirectUri("https://myapp.azurewebsites.net")
    .WithAuthority(AzureCloudInstance.AzurePublic, tenantId)
    .Build();
    
Summary
- Application Builders in MSAL.NET (3.x) help initialize and configure both public and confidential client applications in a flexible, code-first approach.
- Public clients are for scenarios where user interaction is required for authentication (e.g., mobile apps, single-page apps).
- Confidential clients are used for server-side applications where credentials (like client secrets or certificates) can be securely stored.
- Application builders support various modifiers to customize the behavior of the application, such as authority, redirect URI, logging, and telemetry configuration.
