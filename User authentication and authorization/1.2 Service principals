Application Registration in Microsoft Entra ID
- To delegate Identity and Access Management (IAM) functions, an application must be registered with Microsoft Entra ID.
- Registration creates an identity configuration that allows your application to integrate with Microsoft Entra ID.

Types of Applications:
1. Single Tenant: Only accessible within the home tenant.
2. Multi-Tenant: Accessible across other tenants as well.

- When registering an app in the Azure portal, two objects are automatically created:
  1. Application Object: Represents the app globally.
  2. Service Principal Object: Represents the app within the specific tenant where it's used.

Additional Configuration:
- In the portal, you can:
  - Add secrets or certificates.
  - Define scopes.
  - Customize branding (e.g., for sign-in dialogs).
- Service principal objects can also be created using Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, Microsoft Graph, or other tools.

Application Object
- Application Object: Defines the global, template-like configuration of the application and is scoped to the home tenant.
  - It is used to create one or more service principal objects in various tenants where the app is used.
  - The application object includes:
    1. Token Issuance: Defines how tokens can be issued to access the application.
    2. Resources Access: Specifies resources the app needs to access.
    3. Actions: Lists the actions the app can take.
- Microsoft Graph Application Entity: Defines the schema for the application object properties.

Service Principal Object
- Service Principal: Represents the app in each tenant where the application is used.
  - It's a security principal that enforces access policies and permissions for the application in that tenant.
  - A service principal is essential for authenticating and authorizing applications during resource access.

Types of Service Principals:
1. Application:
  - Represents the local instance of the global application object in a specific tenant.
  - Created when the app is used in a tenant and defines:
    - What the app can do in the tenant.
    - Who can access the app.
    - Which resources the app can access.

2. Managed Identity:
  - Represents the identity for applications connecting to resources that support Microsoft Entra authentication.
  - Automatically created when managed identity is enabled.
  - Service principals representing managed identities are not editable directly but can have permissions granted.

3. Legacy:
  - Represents legacy apps created before app registrations or through legacy experiences.
  - May include credentials, service principal names, and reply URLs, but does not have an associated app registration.

Relationship Between Application Objects and Service Principals
- Application Object:
  - A global representation of the app.
  - One-to-one relationship with the app itself.
  - One-to-many relationship with service principal objects (each tenant where the app is used gets its own service principal).

- Service Principal:
  - Must be created in each tenant where the app is used.
  - In a single-tenant application, only one service principal is created (in the home tenant).
  - In a multi-tenant application, a service principal is created in each tenant where users from that tenant consent to use the app.

Key Points for the AZ-204 Exam:
- Understand the process of registering applications with Microsoft Entra ID, including the creation of application and service principal objects.
- Know the differences between single-tenant and multi-tenant applications and how they impact service principal creation.
- Be able to describe the role and properties of application objects and service principal objects in terms of authentication and authorization.
- Understand the types of service principals: Application, Managed Identity, and Legacy.
- Be familiar with the relationship between application objects (global) and service principal objects (local) in various tenants.
