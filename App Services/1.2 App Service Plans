Azure App Service Plans

🔹 Core Concept:
- every App Service must run in an App Service plan.
- the plan defines the compute resources (VM size, number, region, OS, and pricing tier).
- multiple apps can share a single App Service plan — and therefore share resources.

📍 App Service Plan Configuration Includes:
- OS: Windows or Linux
- Region
- Number & size of VMs
- Pricing tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3, Isolated, IsolatedV2)

💲 Pricing Tiers:
Free / Shared (Shared compute):
- runs on shared Azure VMs (with other customers).
- no scale-out, limited CPU — ideal for development/testing only.

Basic / Standard / Premium / PremiumV2 / PremiumV3 (Dedicated compute):
- runs on dedicated VMs.
- only apps in the same plan share compute.
- supports scale-out (more VM instances).

Isolated / IsolatedV2:
- dedicated VMs inside your own Virtual Network (VNet).
- network + compute isolation, highest scaling capacity.

📈 Scaling Behavior:
- App Service Plan = scaling unit.
- if plan has 5 VM instances, all apps run across all 5.
- autoscale settings apply to all apps in the plan.
- diagnostic logs, WebJobs, deployment slots share compute resources too.

🔄 Scaling Up/Down:
- change pricing tier to scale up/down features and VM specs.
- move an app to another App Service plan to isolate performance or scale independently.

🧩 When to Use a Separate App Service Plan:
- app is resource-intensive.
- you want independent scaling from other apps.
- app needs to be in a different region.
