Manually Swapping Deployment Slots
Steps for Manual Swap:
- Go to Deployment Slots page: Select Swap to open the swap dialog box.
- Select Source and Target Slots: Typically, the target slot is production.
- Review Changes: Check the Source Changes and Target Changes tabs to ensure the configurations are correct.
- Complete Swap: After reviewing, select Swap to perform the swap immediately.

Swap with Preview (Multi-phase Swap):
- This allows you to validate the swap before completing it.
- Phase 1: Apply the settings from the target slot to the source slot, with a pause.
- Validation: You can test the source slot to ensure the app functions as expected with the target slot's settings.
- Complete Swap: Once validated, select Complete Swap to finalize the swap.
- Cancel Swap: If issues arise, you can cancel the swap, and the source slot’s settings will revert.

Auto Swap
- Purpose: Auto swap helps automate deployments with zero downtime and no cold starts by swapping the app into production automatically after a code push.
- Configuration:
  - Go to the Deployment Slot settings page.
  - Enable Auto swap and select the target slot.
  - After the code is pushed to the source slot, App Service will automatically swap the app into production.
Note: Auto swap is not supported on Web Apps for Linux or Web App for Containers.

Custom Warm-Up
- Customization: Some applications may require custom actions during the warm-up phase before the swap. 
This can be specified using the applicationInitialization configuration in the web.config file.

Example:
<system.webServer>
    <applicationInitialization>
        <add initializationPage="/" hostName="[app hostname]" />
        <add initializationPage="/Home/About" hostName="[app hostname]" />
    </applicationInitialization>
</system.webServer>

Custom Warm-Up Settings:
- WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH: Specifies the path to ping during warm-up (e.g., /statuscheck).
- WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES: Specifies valid HTTP response codes (e.g., 200, 202).
- WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH: A path to ping whenever the site restarts (not just during swaps).

Roll Back and Monitor a Swap
- If errors occur after a swap (e.g., in production), you can immediately swap the slots back to restore the previous state.
- Monitor Swap Operations:
  - Use the Activity Log to track swap operations. Go to Activity log on the app's resource page in the portal.
  - Search for Swap Web App Slots to see detailed information or errors during the swap process.

This process ensures smooth deployments and easy rollback strategies while minimizing 
downtime and ensuring proper validation of changes before they impact the production environment.
