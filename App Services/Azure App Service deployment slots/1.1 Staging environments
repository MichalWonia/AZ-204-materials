Staging Environments in Azure App Service:
Deployment Slots: You can deploy apps to separate slots (e.g., staging, testing) instead of directly to production. 
This feature is available in the Standard, Premium, or Isolated App Service plan tiers.

Benefits of Staging Slots:
- Pre-deployment Validation: You can validate app changes in a staging slot before swapping it with production.
- Zero Downtime Deployment: Swapping slots ensures that all instances are warmed up before being swapped, eliminating downtime and preventing dropped requests.
- Rollback: After a swap, the previous production app moves to the staging slot, allowing for a quick rollback if the deployment isnâ€™t as expected.

Important Considerations:
- Auto Swap: You can automate the deployment process by configuring auto swap when pre-swap validation is not necessary.
- Slot Limits: Different App Service tiers support different numbers of deployment slots. 
Ensure that your target tier supports the number of slots you need (e.g., Standard tier supports 5 slots).
- Empty Slots: New deployment slots start with no content, even if you clone settings from another slot. 
You can deploy to these slots from different repository branches.
- Slot URLs: The URL for a slot follows the format http://sitename-slotname.azurewebsites.net. 
Ensure the combined site name and slot name are under 59 characters.
