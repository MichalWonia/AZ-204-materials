📦 Deployment Types
Multitenant App Service:
- used with Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, PremiumV2, PremiumV3 SKUs.
- hosted on shared infrastructure, cannot directly connect to your virtual network.

Single-tenant App Service Environment (ASE):
- used with Isolated SKU.
- runs within your Azure Virtual Network (full network control).

🔁 Networking Features by Direction
Inbound Traffic (to your app)	Outbound Traffic (from your app)
🔹 App-assigned address	🔸 Hybrid Connections
🔹 Access restrictions	🔸 Gateway-required VNet Integration
🔹 Service endpoints	🔸 VNet Integration (Standard+)
🔹 Private endpoints	
🧠 Inbound ≠ Outbound: Features work one-way only – don't try to solve inbound scenarios using outbound features (and vice versa).

🔐 Inbound Use Cases and Features
🔹 IP-based SSL / unshared dedicated IP address → Use App-assigned address
🔹 Restrict incoming traffic (IP whitelist) → Use Access restrictions

🏗️ Default Networking Behavior
- Free/Shared plans → Multitenant workers (shared VMs).
- Basic and higher → Apps run on dedicated VMs per App Service Plan.
- Standard App Service plan -> all the apps in that plan run on the same worker. Scaling out = Each instance replicates all apps in the plan.

🚪 Outbound IP Addresses
Outbound Addresses – Azure App Service
🧱 Outbound IP Behavior Depends on the App Service Plan:
- Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium → Use the same VM type for workers.
- PremiumV2 → Uses a different VM type.
- PremiumV3 → Uses another distinct VM type.
- changing the App Service plan tier (especially VM family) changes the set of outbound IP addresses.
- these addresses are shared by all the apps running on the same worker virtual machine family in the App Service deployment

📤 How Outbound IPs Work:
- each worker VM has a pool of outbound IP addresses.
- all apps on the same VM family in the same scale unit share these outbound IPs.
- you need to consider this if you're calling external services (e.g., firewalls or IP whitelisting).



🔍 How to View Outbound IPs:
✅ Current outbound IPs: bash

az webapp show \
  --resource-group <group_name> \
  --name <app_name> \
  --query outboundIpAddresses \
  --output tsv
  
✅ All possible outbound IPs: bash

az webapp show \
  --resource-group <group_name> \
  --name <app_name> \
  --query possibleOutboundIpAddresses \
  --output tsv
