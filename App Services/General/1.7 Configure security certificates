Azure App Service has tools that let you create, upload, or import a private certificate or a public certificate into App Service.

A certificate uploaded into an app is stored in a deployment unit that is bound to the app service plan's
resource group and region combination (internally called a webspace).
The certificate is accessible to other apps in the same resource group and region combination.

Options for adding certificates in App Service:
- Create a free App Service managed certificate: A private certificate that's free of charge and easy to use if
you just need to secure your custom domain in App Service.

- Purchase an App Service certificate: A private certificate managed by Azure. 
It combines the simplicity of automated certificate management and the flexibility of renewal and export options.

- Import a certificate from Key Vault: Useful if you use Azure Key Vault to manage your certificates.

- Upload a private certificate: If you already have a private certificate from a third-party provider, you can upload it.

- Upload a public certificate: Public certificates aren't used to secure custom domains, but you can load them into your
code if you need them to access remote resources.

To use a private certificate in App Service, it must be exported as a password-protected PFX file with a private key of at least 2,048 bits, 
and include the full certificate chain. 
For custom domain security, it needs server authentication and a trusted CA signature.

The free App Service certificate is easy to use for securing custom domains, automatically renewing every six months. 
It requires a Basic, Standard, Premium, or Isolated plan to enable TLS/SSL bindings and client certificates.

The free certificate comes with the following limitations:
- Doesn't support wildcard certificates.
- Doesn't support usage as a client certificate by using certificate thumbprint, which is planned for deprecation and removal.
- Doesn't support private DNS.
- Isn't exportable.
- Isn't supported in an App Service Environment (ASE).
- Only supports alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), and periods (.).
- Only custom domains of length up to 64 characters are supported.

Import an App Service Certificate
If you purchase an App Service Certificate from Azure, Azure manages the following tasks:
- Takes care of the purchase process from certificate provider.
- Performs domain verification of the certificate.
- Maintains the certificate in Azure Key Vault.
- Manages certificate renewal.
- Synchronize the certificate automatically with the imported copies in App Service apps.

If you already have a working App Service certificate, you can:
- Import the certificate into App Service.
- Manage the certificate, such as renew, rekey, and export it.
