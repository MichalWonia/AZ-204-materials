What is an Azure App Service?

It's an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs and mobile back ends. 
App Service can be developed in your favorite programming language or framework and can run on Windows and Linux-based environments.


Scaling support in App Services
- scale up/down: change the number of cores or the amount of RAM available
- scale out/in: ability to increase/decrease the number of machine instances that are running your web app


Container support
App services can be deployed and run in containerized web apps on Windows and Linux:
- container images can be pull from a private Container Registry or Docker Hub
- supports multi-container apps, Windows containers, and Docker Compose for orchestrating container instances.


Deployment slots
Available in Standard App Service Plan tier or better. Deployment slots are live apps with their own host names. 
They enable the option to swap the app content and confugurations between two deployment slots: staging and production.


Limitations of App Service on Linux:
- App Service on Linux isn't supported on Shared pricing tier.
- the Azure portal shows only features that currently work for Linux apps. As features are enabled, they're activated on the portal.
- when deployed to built-in images, your code and content are allocated a storage volume for web content, backed by Azure Storage.
The disk latency of this volume is higher and more variable than the latency of the container filesystem.
Apps that require heavy read-only access to content files might benefit from the custom container option, which places files in the container 
filesystem instead of on the content volume.


App Service Environment
Fully isloated and dedicated environment for running App Service apps provided by Azure.
For App Services the infrastructure is shared, with App Service Environment, compute is dedicated to a single customer.
