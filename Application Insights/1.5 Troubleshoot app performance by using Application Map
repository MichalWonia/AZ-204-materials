🧭 What is Application Map?
The Application Map is a visual, interactive topology of your distributed/microservices application that shows:
- 🧩 Each component (service/app role)
- 🛠 External dependencies (like SQL, Event Hubs)
- 💡 Key health KPIs (like response time, failure rate)
- ⚠️ Active alerts

Think of it as your app's live blueprint, showing what talks to what—and how healthy those connections are.

🔎 Why Use It?
- ✅ Quickly find performance bottlenecks
- 🔥 Spot failure hotspots
- 🧵 Trace call paths across services
- 📈 Drill into metrics, failures, exceptions, and logs from any component

You can even link through to:
- Application Insights telemetry
- Azure SQL Advisor recommendations
- Azure Diagnostics for specific services

🧱 What Shows on the Map?
Components
- These are parts of your app you own (like microservices or app roles).
- Identified using cloud role name.
- May be split across subscriptions or App Insights keys.
- Appear as nodes you can click into for details.

Observed Dependencies
- External services your app calls (e.g., databases, APIs).
- Shown differently (usually as leaves or lighter nodes).
- You can't drill into their internal telemetry.

⚙️ How It Works
- App Map uses Application Insights SDK to trace HTTP dependencies.
- When you open the map, it runs discovery queries to find related components.
- You can press "Update map components" to refresh the map as more are found.
- If your app is fully contained in one Application Insights resource, all roles are shown immediately.

🛠 Troubleshooting with the Map
- Click on a component to:
  - View performance metrics
  - See failure rates
  - Drill into specific requests or exceptions
- Use it during incidents to:
  - Pinpoint where slowness or failures originate
  - Validate if downstream services are healthy

💡 Pro Tip
Manually set cloud_RoleName if:
- You want clear labels for each service in the map
- You’re using a single Application Insights resource for multiple roles

TelemetryInitializer initializer = new TelemetryInitializer();
telemetry.Context.Cloud.RoleName = "MyServiceName";
