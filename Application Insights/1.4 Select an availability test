🔍 Types of Availability Tests
✅ 1. Standard Test (💡 Recommended)
- Replaces the classic URL ping test.
- Supports:
  - HTTP verbs: GET, POST, HEAD
  - Custom headers & payload
  - SSL cert checks
  - Proactive expiration alerts
- Fully managed via Azure Portal and REST API.
- Supports advanced validation criteria.

🟢 Best for most users — use this for checking public endpoints, web apps, APIs, and sites with headers or tokens.

🛠️ 2. Custom TrackAvailability Test
- Use this when:
  - You need complex, app-specific checks
  - You’re testing internal services not publicly exposed
  - You want to run the check from within your app and report the result manually
- You call TrackAvailability() from code and send custom telemetry to Application Insights.

🔧 Best for internal apps or complex logic (e.g., database checks, conditional flows).

⚠️ 3. URL Ping Test (Classic) (Deprecated)
- Legacy test type; only supports simple pings
- No support for headers, POST, or SSL checks
- Retires September 30, 2026

❌ Avoid creating new ones. If you're still using them, start migrating to Standard tests soon.

✨ Pro Tips:
- You can run tests from multiple regions worldwide to check for global availability.
- You can set alert rules to get notified if a test fails or response time degrades.
- Up to 100 tests per Application Insights resource — that’s plenty for most apps.
