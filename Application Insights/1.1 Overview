📊 What is Application Insights?
Application Insights helps developers and DevOps teams monitor live applications, diagnose issues, and understand usage 
trends—from development to production.

🔍 Key Benefits
- Proactive monitoring: Spot performance issues before they affect users.
- Reactive diagnostics: Dig into logs and telemetry after something goes wrong.
- Flexible integration: Supports server-side, client-side, and mobile app instrumentation.

🛠️ Core Features
Feature	                                    Description
Live Metrics	                              Real-time view of app activity (requests, failures, performance).
Availability Tests	                        Synthetic pings to test uptime and responsiveness.
App Map	                                    Visualizes your app’s architecture and shows health of dependencies.
Smart                                       Detection	Uses AI to detect failures and anomalies automatically.
Distributed Tracing	                        Trace requests across services/microservices.
Usage Analytics	                            Understand how users interact with your app.
GitHub / Azure DevOps Integration	          Create work items directly from telemetry.

📦 Data It Collects
- Request metrics (rate, duration, failures)
- Dependency data (external API/database calls)
- Exceptions (server + browser, with stack traces)
- Page views (browser-side performance)
- AJAX call data
- User/session data
- Performance counters (CPU, memory, etc.)
- Host diagnostics (e.g., Docker or Azure VMs)
- Custom events and metrics you define

🧪 How to Get Started
Option	                                        When to Use
Runtime instrumentation	                        For already deployed apps—no code changes needed.
Development-time integration	                  Customize telemetry in your code (e.g., with SDKs).
Browser instrumentation	                        Track client-side interactions and performance.
Mobile tracking	                                Use Visual Studio App Center integration.
Availability tests	                            Simulate user pings from Azure test servers.

💸 Pricing Tip
- There's a free tier—great for small apps or trials.
- Costs increase as your telemetry volume grows, so filter what you send if needed.
