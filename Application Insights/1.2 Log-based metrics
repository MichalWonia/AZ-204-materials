📏 What Are Log-Based Metrics?
Log-based metrics are metrics derived from Application Insights logs (stored events). 
They're built by executing Kusto queries on collected telemetry data (like requests, exceptions, or custom events).

🔄 Two Types of Metrics in Application Insights
Metric Type	                                      How It's Built	                                                                  Best For	                                    Performance
Log-Based Metrics	                                Built from querying raw telemetry logs using KQL	                                Deep analysis, ad-hoc diagnostics	            Slower (processed at query time)
Standard (Preaggregated) Metrics	                Pre-aggregated during collection; stored as time series	                          Dashboards, near real-time alerts	            Faster (better for dashboards & alerts)

🧠 Why Use Log-Based Metrics?
- Richer dimensions and filters
- Full control with Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- Great for custom diagnostics, troubleshooting specific sessions, or filtering by custom properties
- Useful when you need exact details (like unique user counts, specific dependency traces)

✅ Example: Want to find how many users triggered a specific API and which ones caused failures? Log-based metrics are your go-to.

⚙️ How Log-Based Metrics Work
- Data comes from:
  - SDK-based custom events (TrackEvent, TrackException, TrackDependency)
  - Auto-instrumented telemetry (e.g., requests, dependencies, exceptions)
- Events are stored as logs.
- Metrics are created from Kusto queries over these logs.
- You can visualize them or create alerts based on their output.

⚡ Standard (Preaggregated) Metrics Highlights
- Preprocessed before storage → lightweight & fast at runtime
- Immune to sampling → more accurate even with telemetry reduction
- Supported by newer SDKs (e.g., .NET SDK v2.7+) and GetMetric(...) API
- Best for:
  - Real-time alerting
  - Dashboards that update quickly
  - Scenarios needing low-latency

🔁 Coexistence
- Both metric types are available in Application Insights.
- In Metrics Explorer:
  - Use the namespace selector to switch between:
    - Log-based metrics
    - Standard metrics (preview)

🧩 Sampling & Accuracy Notes
- Sampling and filtering reduce stored logs → affects log-based metric accuracy
- Preaggregated metrics are built before sampling → remain accurate

💡 Pro Tips
- Use log-based metrics for detailed diagnostics or when you need to slice and dice with custom dimensions.
- Use standard metrics for realtime alerting, dashboards, and performance-critical monitoring.
