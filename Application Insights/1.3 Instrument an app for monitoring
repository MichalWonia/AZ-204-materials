üõ†Ô∏è Instrumentation Methods
‚úÖ 1. Autoinstrumentation (Codeless)
- What it is: Adds telemetry without modifying code
- How it works: Set up through environment variables, configuration files, or hosting environment (like Azure App Service or Azure Functions)
- Pros: Super easy, no coding required
- Cons: Limited customization, not available for all platforms/languages

Use it when: You just want to turn it on and go, especially in supported environments like .NET on App Service or Java on Azure Kubernetes.

üßë‚Äçüíª 2. Manual Instrumentation
You modify the app‚Äôs code to capture custom telemetry or enhance control. Two main options:

Option A: Application Insights SDKs
- Install a language-specific SDK (Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.*)
- Instrument:
  - Web apps
  - Background services
  - Client-side JavaScript
- Use TelemetryClient to log:
  - TrackEvent()
  - TrackMetric()
  - TrackException()
  - TrackDependency()

Use it when:
- You need custom telemetry
- You want fine control
- Autoinstrumentation is unavailable

Option B: Azure Monitor OpenTelemetry Distros
- OpenTelemetry = vendor-neutral instrumentation standard
- Use Microsoft‚Äôs OpenTelemetry Distro to export data to Application Insights
- Supports spans, metrics, logs, etc.

Use it when:
- You're in a polyglot or cloud-native environment
- You want a vendor-neutral setup
- You're already using OpenTelemetry elsewhere

üîÅ Comparing Terms (App Insights vs. OpenTelemetry)
App Insights Term	                                  OpenTelemetry Term

Channel	                                            Exporter
Codeless / Agent-based	                            Autoinstrumentation
Requests	                                          Server spans
Dependencies	                                      Client/Internal spans
Operation ID	                                      Trace ID
Operation Parent ID	                                Span ID

üéØ Getting Started
Pick the path based on your scenario:
- Autoinstrumentation ‚Üí Easiest path, especially for cloud-hosted apps
- Manual (SDK) ‚Üí Great for full customization or legacy apps
- OpenTelemetry ‚Üí Ideal for scalable, cloud-native microservices
