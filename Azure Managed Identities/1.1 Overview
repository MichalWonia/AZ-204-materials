🔐 Managed Identities in Azure
Managed identities help securely access Azure resources like Key Vault, Storage Accounts, and databases without hardcoding secrets or 
credentials in your application.

🚫 The Problem:
Developers often struggle with:
- Secret/credential management
- Secure service-to-service communication

✅ The Solution: Managed Identities
Managed identities are identities in Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) automatically managed by Azure. 
They allow your app to authenticate to Azure services securely — no credentials needed.

🔄 Two Types of Managed Identities
Feature	                        System-Assigned	                                        User-Assigned
Created with	                  An Azure resource (e.g., VM, App Service)	              Manually as a standalone Azure resource
Lifecycle tied to	              The parent resource	                                    Independent from any specific resource
Sharing between resources	      ❌ Cannot be shared	                                  ✅ Can be used across multiple resources
Best for	                      Single-resource workloads	                              Shared identity across multiple services

🔄 Internals
- Managed identities are special service principals.
- Automatically cleaned up when deleted.
- Azure handles credential rotation behind the scenes.

🧠 When to Use What
System-Assigned:
- Single-resource workloads (e.g., app on one VM)
- Simpler setup and teardown

User-Assigned:
- Multi-resource workloads
- Pre-authorized access scenarios
- When resources are recycled often (e.g., autoscaling VMs)

✅ Supported Scenarios
You can use managed identities with any Azure service that supports Microsoft Entra authentication (like Azure Key Vault, Azure SQL, Azure Storage, etc.).
