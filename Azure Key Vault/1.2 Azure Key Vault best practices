üîê Azure Key Vault Best Practices
Azure Key Vault is essential for securely managing secrets, like API keys, passwords, and certificates. A vault is a logical container for these secrets.

‚úÖ Authentication Best Practices
Use Managed Identities (Recommended):
- Ideal for apps running in Azure (VMs, Azure Functions, App Services, etc.).
- No need to manage secret rotation ‚Äî Azure handles it for you.
- Best practice for most Azure-hosted applications.

Avoid:
- Service principal + certificate ‚Äì Requires manual certificate rotation.
- Service principal + client secret ‚Äì Hard to rotate and manage securely.

üîê Encryption of Data in Transit
- TLS enforced for all traffic between clients and Azure Key Vault.
- Uses RSA 2048-bit encryption and Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS).
- Protects data from tampering, interception, and forgery.

üõ°Ô∏è Operational Best Practices
1. Use Separate Key Vaults
- One vault per application per environment (Dev, Test, Prod).
- Reduces cross-environment exposure and limits blast radius if compromised.

2. Access Control
- Secure access using Azure RBAC or Key Vault access policies.
- Principle of least privilege: Only give required permissions to users/apps.

3. Backups
- Back up your vault routinely, especially on changes (create/update/delete).
- Use automated scripts or tools to perform backups regularly.

4. Enable Logging
- Turn on Azure Monitor logs, Activity logs, and Alerts.
- Helps track access patterns, detect misuse, and respond to incidents.

5. Soft Delete & Purge Protection
- Soft Delete allows recovery of deleted secrets.
- Purge Protection prevents immediate, permanent deletion.
- Both are crucial for protecting against accidental or malicious deletions.
